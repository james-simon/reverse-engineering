# Reverse Engineering the Neural Tangent Kernel

This repository contains IPython notebooks for running selected experiments from [Reverse Engineering the Neural Tangent Kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03186). Notebooks are all compatible with Google Colab.

This library makes heavy use of [`neural_tangents`](https://github.com/google/neural-tangents), a Google library for fast net kernel computations, and [`eigenlearning`](https://github.com/james-simon/eigenlearning), a library from Jamie Simon that provides functions for synthetic data generation and network training with `neural_tangents`. Everything here runs as of 2022 but might not be maintained.

Direct any questions to james.simon@berkeley.edu!
