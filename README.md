# Shallow Learning

This repository contains IPython notebooks for running the experiments and generating the figures in [On the Power of Shallow Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03186). All run in minutes with a single GPU on Colab Pro. Feel free to direct any questions to james.simon@berkeley.edu!
